When detector_state is run by the user they will be prompted with an option to enter the room and the status of the room
There are 3 rooms. These rooms are named 1, 2 and 3. 
When detector_state is run, the status of only one room can be changed. (Must be run twice to change the status of two seperate rooms) 
The status entered must be ON or OFF (all caps). 

dash.sh is the layout of the dashboard for the user to see the status for each room
dashboard.sh will print out this dash.sh script every second in case there is a change. 

the detector and sprinkler folders each contain 3 subfolders (1,2 and 3 - a folder representing each room)
inside these subfolders, there is a log file containing the status of each room for sprinklers and the detector.
